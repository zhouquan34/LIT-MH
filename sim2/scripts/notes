Scripts used to generate the table in the manuscript. 
For convenience, the number of local modes are stored in the file modes.txt.
To calculate the number of local modes from simulation, the RWMH algorithm has to be re-run with "-R 1" which takes a lot of time.
For informed algorithms, one can use command "perl scripts/multi.pl i2" to get the mean number of local modes.
